% This section will describe the experiments conducted throughout this present master thesis. These experiments are divided into two main categories, that are still highly cohesive. The two categories are the experiments regarding the learning experience and the Raspberry Pi cluster as a learning object. Lastly the experiments concerning resilience in relation to finding ways that will highlight the problems and solutions to distributed computing. The experiments concerning resilience will focus upon the anti-patterns and patterns described by Michael Nygard and the resilience that Kubernetes as a platform will provide. These experiments and their results should provide the basis of determining if the taken approach will help aligning the students mental model with the real world of cloud computing and distributed systems.
