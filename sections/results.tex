\chapter{Results}

This chapter will present the result of the described experiments in Chapter~\ref{chap:experiments}. The structure of Chapter~\ref{chap:experiments} will be continued to ensure consistency. A walkthrough of the experiments, regarding the learning experience and the Raspberry Pi cluster as a tangible learning object, will be presented first. Thereafter, results of the experiments of application- and infrastructure level will be presented.

\section{Experiment 1 - Learning Experience}



\section{Experiment 2 - Resilience}



\section{Experiment 3 - Overall evaluation of the learning experience}
