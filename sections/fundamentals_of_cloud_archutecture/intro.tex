\begin{theorem}
    Cloud computing has enabled new ways of designing architectures. An understanding of cloud architecture fundamentals is, therefore, necessary to design and build a learning activity and a tangible cloud computing cluster.
\end{theorem}

\noindent
The previous chapter introduced cloud computing infrastructures including cluster management systems such as Kubernetes. This chapter will focus on the architectural decisions for applications designed to run on a cloud computing infrastructure. Furthermore, this chapter describes the architectural paradigm shift from monolithic application architecture towards a finer grained service-oriented architecture.
