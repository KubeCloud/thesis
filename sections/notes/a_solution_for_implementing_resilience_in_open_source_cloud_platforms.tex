\section{A Solution for Implementing Resilience in Open Source Cloud Platforms, Sucium, Cernat, Todoran, et al, 2012}

\begin{itemize}
  \item SlapOS is the first open source operating system for Distributed Cloud Computing.
  \item SlapOS is based on a grid computing daemon.
  \item SlapOS does not use big server farms of data servers or virtualization, it uses PCs at home that store some part of data and run application instances.
  \item Resilience is the ability of a system or network architecture to continue to operate in case of failure. To make the concept of resilience more operational we say that resilience is to design basis threats and events - this can be expressed in the usual terms of fault tolerance, availability, robustness, and so forth.
  \item SlapOS runs software instances as processes instead of virtual machines, this makes SlapOS able to use hardware resources more efficiently.
\end{itemize}
