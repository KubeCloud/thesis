\section{Requirements for a Learning Object}
In order to specify the requirements for KubeCloud, we must understand the constraints. The course budget constrained the total cost to DKK 13,000 (USD \$1.957\footnote{DKK-USD currency: 664}). The budget should allow for a minimum of five clusters (20 students with four students per cluster) to be handed out. Another major constraint is the limited implementation time before the course start (thesis start: January 25th, 2016; course start: April 7th, 2016). Before the implementation, a set of requirements are specified for KubeCloud within the limited constraints:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0.05em}
  \item KubeCloud shall be tangible and allow for practical hands-on experimentation
  \item KubeCloud shall allow for deployment of microservice architecture
  \item KubeCloud shall allow for containerization with Docker
  \item KubeCloud shall allow for container management with Kubernetes
  \item KubeCloud shall allow students to pull out cables to inject failures
  \item KubeCloud shall be able to visualize the state of the cluster
  \item KubeCloud shall visually have characteristics of a server rack
  \item KubeCloud shall be transportable 
  \item KubeCloud shall have a small physical form factor and be able to be carried around in a bag
  \item KubeCloud shall allow for shutdown and restart with a frequency twice a week
  \item KubeCloud shall allow for configuration of the cluster size
\end{itemize}

\noindent
The following sections will describe and discuss the choices made in order to satisfy these requirements.
